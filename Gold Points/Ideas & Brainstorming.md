In the DevTools, there is a command "availableGP", if we are able to find a way to set the availableGP element to a certain number, we might be able to use the console to create a fraudulent network packet that makes the client "receive" gold from the server. When you type in the command availableGP, the response for syntax is 
"Æ’ (e,t){if(e&&t){const e=undefined;return Number(t.dailyParentGp)||0}return 0}" (Not including the quotation marks). If e=undefined, then it is a constant, so we shouldn't have to worry about that part. But the dailyParentGp might be an issue because that number is a variable. So, we need to find the variables e,t, and return number. But we stil don't know if these numbers are obtainable.
